	abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence ({AI}) has opened the possibility of automated content production, including coding in software development, which can significantly influence the participation and performance of software developers. To explore this impact, we investigate the role of {GitHub} Copilot, a generative {AI} pair programmer, on software development in open-source community, where multiple developers voluntarily collaborate on software projects. Using {GitHub}'s dataset for open-source repositories and a generalized synthetic control method, we find that Copilot significantly enhances project-level productivity by 6.5\%. Delving deeper, we dissect the key mechanisms driving this improvement. Our findings reveal a 5.5\% increase in individual productivity and a 5.4\% increase in participation. However, this is accompanied with a 41.6\% increase in integration time, potentially due to higher coordination costs. Interestingly, we also observe the differential effects among developers. We discover that core developers achieve greater projectlevel productivity gains from using Copilot, benefiting more in terms of individual productivity and participation compared to peripheral developers, plausibly due to their deeper familiarity with software projects. We also find that the increase in project-level productivity is accompanied with no change in code quality. We conclude that {AI} pair programmers bring benefits to developers to automate and augment their code, but human developers’ knowledge of software projects can enhance the benefits. In summary, our research underscores the role of {AI} pair programmers in impacting project-level productivity within the open-source community and suggests potential implications for the structure of open-source software projects.},

Results: This review identifies a significant adoption of {GenAI} for architectural decision support and architectural reconstruction. {OpenAI} {GPT} models are predominantly applied and there is consistent use of techniques such as few-shot prompting and retrieved-augmented generation ({RAG}). {GenAI} has been applied mostly to the initial stages of the Software Development Life Cycle ({SDLC}), such as Requirements-to-Architecture and Architecture-to-Code. Monolithic and microservice architectures were the main dominant targets. However, rigorous testing of {GenAI} outputs was typically missing from the studies. Among the most frequent challenges are model precision, hallucinations, ethical aspects, privacy issues, lack of architecture-specific datasets, and the absence of sound evaluation frameworks.
Conclusions: {GenAI} shows significant potential in software design, but there are several challenges on its way toward greater adoption. Research efforts should target designing general evaluation methodologies, handling ethics and precision, increasing transparency and explainability, and promoting architectural-specific datasets and benchmarks to overcome the gap between theoretical possibility and practical use.},

	abstract = {The rapid adoption of generative {AI} in software development has impacted the industry, yet its effects on developers with visual impairments remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we used an Activity Theory framework to examine how developers with visual impairments interact with {AI} coding assistants. For this purpose, we conducted a study where developers who are visually impaired completed a series of programming tasks using a generative {AI} coding assistant. We uncovered that, while participants found the {AI} assistant beneficial and reported significant advantages, they also highlighted accessibility challenges. Specifically, the {AI} coding assistant often exacerbated existing accessibility barriers and introduced new challenges. For example, it overwhelmed users with an excessive number of suggestions, leading developers who are visually impaired to express a desire for ``{AI} timeouts.'' Additionally, the generative {AI} coding assistant made it more difficult for developers to switch contexts between the {AI}-generated content and their own code. Despite these challenges, participants were optimistic about the potential of {AI} coding assistants to transform the coding experience for developers with visual impairments. Our findings emphasize the need to apply activity-centered design principles to generative {AI} assistants, ensuring they better align with user behaviors and address specific accessibility needs. This approach can enable the assistants to provide more intuitive, inclusive, and effective experiences, while also contributing to the broader goal of enhancing accessibility in software development.},

	abstract = {Agile system development life cycle ({SDLC}) focuses on typical functional and non-functional system requirements for developing traditional software systems. However, Artificial Intelligent ({AI}) systems are different in nature and have distinct attributes such as (1) autonomy, (2) adaptiveness, (3) content generation, (4) decision-making, (5) predictability and (6) recommendation. Agile {SDLC} needs to be enhanced to support the {AI} system development and ongoing post-deployment adaptation. The challenge is: how can agile {SDLC} be enhanced to support {AI} systems? The scope of this paper is limited to {AI} system enabled decision automation. Thus, this paper proposes the use of decision science to enhance the agile {SDLC} to support the {AI} system development. Decision science is the study of decision-making, which seems useful to identify, analyse and describe decisions and their architecture subject to automation via {AI} systems. Specifically, this paper discusses the decision architecture in detail within the overall context of agile {SDLC} for {AI} systems. The application of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the help of an example scenario of insurance claim processing. This initial work indicated the usability of a decision science to enhancing the agile {SDLC} for designing and implementing the {AI} systems for decision-automation. This work provides an initial foundation for further work in this new area of decision architecture and agile {SDLC} for {AI} systems.},

	abstract = {The rapid advancement of Generative {AI} (Gen {AI}) technologies, particularly tools like {ChatGPT}, is significantly impacting the labor market by reshaping job roles and skill requirements. This study examines the demand for {ChatGPT}-related skills in the U.S. labor market by analyzing job advertisements collected from major job platforms between May and December 2023. Using text mining and topic modeling techniques, we extracted and analyzed the Gen {AI}-related skills that employers are hiring for. Our analysis identified five distinct {ChatGPT}-related skill sets: general familiarity, creative content generation, marketing, advanced functionalities (such as prompt engineering), and product development. In addition, the study provides insights into job attributes such as occupation titles, degree requirements, salary ranges, and other relevant job characteristics. These findings highlight the increasing integration of Gen {AI} across various industries, emphasizing the growing need for both foundational knowledge and advanced technical skills. The study offers valuable insights into the evolving demands of the labor market, as employers seek candidates equipped to leverage generative {AI} tools to improve productivity, streamline processes, and drive innovation.},

	abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence ({AI}) continues to increase and evolve, including in software engineering ({SE}). This integration involves processes traditionally entrusted to humans, such as coding. However, the impact on sociotechnical processes like code review remains underexplored. In this interview-based study (20 interviewees), we investigate how software engineers perceive and engage with Large Language Model ({LLM})-assisted code reviews compared to human peerled reviews. In this inherently human-centric process, we aim to understand how software engineers navigate the introduction of {AI} into collaborative workflows. We found that engagement in code review is multi-dimensional, spanning cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. The introduction of {LLM}-assisted review impacts some of these attributes. For example, there is less need for emotional regulation and coping mechanisms when dealing with an {LLM} compared to peers. However, the cognitive load sometimes is higher in dealing with {LLM}-generated feedback due to its excessive details. Software engineers use a similar sense-making process to evaluate and adopt feedback suggestions from their peers and the {LLM}. However, the {LLM} feedback adoption is constrained by trust and lack of context in the review. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how {AI} tools are impacting {SE} socio-technical processes and provide insights into the future of {AI}-human collaboration in {SE} practices.},

This paper explores the significant technological shifts since our previous review in 2022, highlighting how these developments have expanded creative opportunities and efficiency. These technological advancements have enhanced the capabilities of text-to-image, text-to-video, and multimodal generation technologies. In particular, key breakthroughs in {LLMs} have established new benchmarks in conversational {AI}, while advancements in image generators have revolutionized content creation. We also discuss {AI} integration into postproduction workflows, which has significantly accelerated and refined traditional processes. Despite these innovations, challenges remain—particularly for the media industry—due to the demands on communication traffic from creative content. We therefore include data compression and quality assessment in this paper. Furthermore, we highlight the trend toward unified {AI} frameworks capable of addressing multiple creative tasks and underscore the importance of human oversight to mitigate {AI}-generated inaccuracies.

Claims include artificial intelligence ({AI}) being poised to revolutionize business and society and dramatically change personal life. However, it is not clear how this technology, with its significantly distinct features from past {AI} technologies, has transformative potential or how researchers in information systems should react to it. In this paper, we consider the evolving and emerging trends of {AI} in order to examine its present and predict its future impacts. Many existing papers on {GenAI} are either too technical for most information systems researchers or lack the depth needed to appreciate the potential impacts of {GenAI}. We, therefore, attempt to bridge the technical and organizational communities of {GenAI} from a system-oriented sociotechnical perspective. Specifically, we explore the unique features of {GenAI}, which are rooted in the continued change from symbolism to connectionism, and the deep systemic and inherent properties of human-{AI} ecosystems. We retrace the evolution of {AI} that proceeded the level of adoption, adaption, and use found today, in order to propose future research on various impacts of {GenAI} in both business and society within the context of information systems research. Our efforts are intended to contribute to the creation of a well-structured research agenda in the information systems community to support innovative strategies and operations enabled by this new wave of {AI}.},

In some activities, such as coding, {AI} has already been an everyday tool, but in software testing activities {AI} it has not yet made a significant breakthrough. In this paper, the objective was to identify what kind of empirical research with industry context has been conducted on {AI} in software testing, as well as how {AI} has been adopted in software testing practice. To achieve this, we performed a systematic mapping study of recent (2020 and later) studies on {AI} adoption in software testing in the industry, and applied thematic analysis to identify common themes and categories, such as the real-world use cases and benefits, in the found papers. The observations suggest that {AI} is not yet heavily utilized in software testing, and still relatively few studies on {AI} adoption in software testing have been conducted in the industry context to solve real-world problems. Earlier studies indicated there was a noticeable gap between the actual use cases and actual benefits versus the expectations, which we analyzed further. While there were numerous potential use cases for {AI} in software testing, such as test case generation, code analysis, and intelligent test automation, the reported actual implementations and observed benefits were limited. In addition, the systematic mapping study revealed a potential problem with false positive search results in online databases when using the search string ”artificial intelligence”.},

Through the lens of economic theories, we highlight the intertemporal impacts of {AI} on human livelihood and the structural changes in labor markets that exacerbate income inequality. Additionally, the closed-source approach of major stakeholders in {AI} development resembles rent-seeking behavior through exploiting resources, breeding mediocrity in creative labor, and monopolizing innovation. To address this, we argue in favor of a robust international copyright anatomy supported by implementing collective licensing that ensures fair compensation mechanisms for using data to train {AI} models.

We outline the unique economic properties of digital labor, such as unprecedented scalability, intangibility, self-improvement through autonomous learning, rapid obsolescence, and nuanced substitutability with human labor. By explicitly integrating digital labor into economic growth models (for example, the Solow and Romer frameworks), we demonstrate critical strategic implications for business leaders, including new approaches to productivity tracking, resource allocation, investment strategy, and organizational design.

	abstract = {Generative {AI} has transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural language interfaces and the emergence of autonomous agents capable of acting on users' behalf. While early applications have improved individual productivity, these gains have largely been confined to predefined tasks within existing workflows. We argue that the more profound economic impact lies in reducing communication frictions between consumers and businesses. This shift could reorganize markets, redistribute power, and catalyze the creation of new products and services. We explore the implications of an agentic economy, where assistant agents act on behalf of consumers and service agents represent businesses, interacting programmatically to facilitate transactions. A key distinction we draw is between unscripted interactions -- enabled by technical advances in natural language and protocol design -- and unrestricted interactions, which depend on market structures and governance. We examine the current limitations of siloed and end-to-end agents, and explore future scenarios shaped by technical standards and market dynamics. These include the potential tension between agentic walled gardens and an open web of agents, implications for advertising and discovery, the evolution of micro-transactions, and the unbundling and rebundling of digital goods. Ultimately, we argue that the architecture of agentic communication will determine the extent to which generative {AI} democratizes access to economic opportunity.},

	abstract = {{AI} governance has transitioned from soft law—such as national {AI} strategies and voluntary guidelines—to binding regulation at an unprecedented pace. This evolution has produced a complex legislative landscape: blurred definitions of “{AI} regulation” mislead the public and create a false sense of safety; divergent regulatory frameworks risk fragmenting international cooperation; and uneven access to key information heightens the danger of regulatory capture. Clarifying the scope and substance of {AI} regulation is vital to uphold democratic rights and align international {AI} efforts. We present a taxonomy to map the global landscape of {AI} regulation. Our framework targets essential metrics—technology or application-focused rules, horizontal or sectoral regulatory coverage, ex ante or ex post interventions, maturity of the digital legal landscape, enforcement mechanisms, and level of stakeholder participation—to classify the breadth and depth of {AI} regulation. We apply this framework to five early movers: the European Union’s {AI} Act, the United States’ Executive Order 14110, Canada’s {AI} and Data Act, China’s Interim Measures for Generative {AI} Services, and Brazil’s {AI} Bill 2338/2023. We further offer an interactive visualization that distills these dense legal texts into accessible insights, highlighting both commonalities and differences. By delineating what qualifies as {AI} regulation and clarifying each jurisdiction’s approach, our taxonomy reduces legal uncertainty, supports evidence-based policymaking, and lays the groundwork for more inclusive, globally coordinated {AI} governance.},

However, it remains unclear how {UX} practitioners would adopt such Generative {UI} ({GenUI}) models in a way that is integral and beneficial to their work. To answer this question, we conducted a formative study with 37 {UX}-related professionals that consisted of four roles: {UX} designers, {UX} researchers, software engineers, and product managers. Using a state-of-the-art {GenUI} tool, each participant went through a week-long, individual mini-project exercise with role-specific tasks, keeping a daily journal of their usage and experiences with {GenUI}, followed by a semi-structured interview. We report findings on participants’ workflow using the {GenUI} tool, how {GenUI} can support all and each specific roles, and existing gaps between {GenUI} and users’ needs and expectations, which lead to design implications to inform future work on {GenUI} development.},

	abstract = {Generative {UI} is transforming interface design by facilitating {AIdriven} collaborative workflows between designers and computational systems. This study establishes a working definition of Generative {UI} through a multi-method qualitative approach, integrating insights from a systematic literature review of 127 publications, expert interviews with 18 participants, and analyses of 12 case studies. Our findings identify five core themes that position Generative {UI} as an iterative and co-creative process. We highlight emerging design models, including hybrid creation, curation-based workflows, and {AI}-assisted refinement strategies. Additionally, we examine ethical challenges, evaluation criteria, and interaction models that shape the field. By proposing a conceptual foundation, this study advances both theoretical discourse and practical implementation, guiding future {HCI} research toward responsible and effective generative {UI} design practices.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}) is reshaping the labor market by changing the task content of occupations. This study investigates the impact of {AI} development on the emergence of new work, employment, and wages in the United States from 2015 to 2022. I develop innovative methods to measure occupational and industry exposure to {AI} technologies that substitute labor (automation {AI} ) or enhance workers’ output (augmentation {AI}), and to identify new work (i.e., new job titles). To address endogeneity, I use instrumental variable estimators, leveraging {AI} development in countries with limited economic ties to the United States. The findings indicate that automation {AI} negatively impacts new work, employment, and wages in low-skilled occupations, while augmentation {AI} fosters the emergence of new work and raises wages for high-skilled occupations. These results suggest that {AI} may contribute to rising wage inequality.},

	shorttitle = {Open Sourcing {GPTs}},
	abstract = {This paper explores the economic underpinnings of open sourcing advanced large language models ({LLMs}) by for-profit companies. Empirical analysis reveals that: (1) {LLMs} are compatible with R\&D portfolios of numerous technologically differentiated firms; (2) open-sourcing likelihood decreases with an {LLM}’s performance edge over rivals, but increases for models from large tech companies; and (3) opensourcing an advanced {LLM} led to an increase in research-related activities. Motivated by these findings, a theoretical framework is developed to examine factors influencing a profit-maximizing firm’s open-sourcing decision. The analysis frames this decision as a trade-off between accelerating technology growth and securing immediate financial returns. A key prediction from the theoretical analysis is an inverted-U-shaped relationship between the owner’s size, measured by its share of {LLM}-compatible applications, and its propensity to open source the {LLM}. This finding suggests that moderate market concentration may be beneficial to the open source ecosystems of multi-purpose software technologies.},
